Started with this:
"Sketch uses 20718 bytes (67%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.
Global variables use 1310 bytes (63%) of dynamic memory, leaving 738 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes."
Now this:
"Sketch uses 16334 bytes (53%) of program storage space. Maximum is 30720 bytes.
Global variables use 838 bytes (40%) of dynamic memory, leaving 1210 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes."
